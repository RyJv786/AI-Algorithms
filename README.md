# AI-Algorithms

Unsupervised Learning: K-Means and Hierachial clustering algorithms were used and compared to see how they group data.

Supervised Learning: K-Nearest Neighbour was implemented to compare the accuracy of pruned trees using different values of K.

Deep Learning: Training a neural network on a dataset to record accuracy and change the number of neurons, activation functions, and training epochs to see how it changes the accuracy.
